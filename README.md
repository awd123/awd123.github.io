My website. Click [here](https://awd123.github.io) to visit it.

## information
This website is built with [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com).

Feel free to use the file [`css/partials/_mixins.scss`](css/partials/_mixins.scss) in any website. This file contains useful SCSS mixins for `transition`, `border-radius`, `background-size`, and `transform`.
Example:
```scss
/* transition mixin */
@mixin transition($time) {
  -webkit-transition: all $time;
     -moz-transition: all $time;
          transition: all $time;
}
```
