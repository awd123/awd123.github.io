## information
This website is built with [CoffeeScript](coffeescript.org) and [Sass](sass-lang.com).

Feel free to use the file `css/partials/_mixins.scss` in any website. This file contains useful SCSS mixins for `transition`, `border-radius`, `background-size`, and `transform`.
Example:

```scss
/* transition mixin */
@mixin transition($time) {
  -webkit-transition: all $time;
     -moz-transition: all $time;
          transition: all $time;
}
```
